# Data stucture and algorithm

## Definition:
      Data Stucture: Data stucture is a data organization,management and storage formate that enables efficient access and modification 
      Algorithm: Algorithm is as finite set of instructions that are carried in a specific order to perform a specific task
Data strucure and algorithm is very important topic in computer science
## Operation Performed on datastructure
     1.Traversing:Accessing each record onces 
     2.Inserting:Adding new record to the stucture
     3.Deleting:Removing any record from the stucture
     4.Searching:Searching any record on the stucture
     5.Sorting:Arranging the record on some logical order
     6.Merging:Combine the record in two different sorted life to a single sorted file

To understand time complexity space complexity and solving real life problem algorithm is necessary.

# Data stucture and algorithm

## Definition:
       ### Data Stucture: Data stucture is a data organization,management and storage formate that enables efficient access and modification 
       ### Algorithm: AlgoAlgorithm is as finite set of instructions that are carried in a specific order to perform a specific task
Data strucure and algorithm is very important topic in computer science
Store, manage,searching and sorting to perform this basic task on any database there should be some practical approach datasture and algorithm is making it easy for us to do it.
To understand time complexity space complexity and solving real life problem algorithm is necessary.

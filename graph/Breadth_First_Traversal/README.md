## Breadth-First Traversal
This is one kind of graph traversal method ,in which queue data sturcture is used
** sourse vertex to all vertex canbe traverserd in this method** 
## Graph is defined as G(V,E)
      i) V-->no of vertex
      ii)E-->no of edges

## Time complexity 
     i) O(V+E) -->Adjacency Lisr is used
     ii)O $((v^2)$  -->Adjacency matrix is used
     iii)$(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ 
    $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

# Spanning Treee
Formal definition of spanning tree is G'*e*(G) thats mean it is subgraph of a graph 
## IMPORTANT Characteristics:
    i) V'=V (means vertex number will be same 
    ii)_E'=|V|-1_
    
## Properties of Spanning trees:
    1.Removing one edge to the spanning tree will make the graph disconnected 
    2.Adding one edge to the spanning tree will create a loop
    3.**If each edge has distinct weight then there will be one uniques MST**
    4.A ccomplete undirected graph can have **n^(n-2)** no of S.T
    5.From a complete graph by removing max(e -n+1)edges spanning tree can be produced
